                  <p class="card-text">PASC was the next level up. There were multiple travel tournaments which I had never done before, the practices became more intense, and it was overall way more competitve than everything I had done in the past. We were in the NPL League, but moved to the Girls Academy League (GA) after the Development Academy (DA) shut down.</p>

                  <p class="card-text">Now this was even more of a step up. I moved to this club knowing its reputation of getting kids recruited by top schools, so I knew what I was getting into. Not only do we travel further for games and tournaments, we're treated like professionals while we're away. Phones are taken away at curfew, we're on a strict diet to make sure we have the right nutrition for games, and we are held to the highest standard of behavior. We started in the GA league, playing against teams like PASC, but moved to ECNL to play at an even higher level.</p>

                  <p class="card-text">I started playing Menlo soccer my freshman year, and have played every season from then to now. I was the starting varsity goalkeeper and still am today. It's a lot more relaxed then my club team, but still a competitive environment with our drive to win league every year.</p>
