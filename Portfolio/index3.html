       <span class="box-header">Team #1: AYSO</span> <br>
        Time: 2009-2013 <br>
        Description: AYSO was my first soccer team. I played every position possible but did not end up playing goalie since there were none.

    <div class = "box2">
        <span class="box-header">Team #2: Alpine Strikers</span> <br>
        Time: 2013-2018 <br>
        Description: Alpine Strikers was the next step up from AYSO. It was more competitive but still wasn't what I wanted as I grew my love for soccer. I also found my love for playing goalie here. We were in the Premier league, but sometimes played up in Gold.

    <div class = "box3">
        <span class= "box-header">Team #3: Palo Alto Soccer Club</span> <br>
        Time: 2018-2021 <br>
        Description: PASC was the next level up. There were multiple travel tournaments which I had never done before, the practices became more intense, and it was overall way more competitve than everything I had done in the past. We were in the NPL League, but moved to the Girls Academy League (GA) after the Development Academy (DA) shut down.

    <div class = "box4">
        <span class= "box-header">Team #4: FC Bay Area Surf</span> <br>
        Time: 2021-present <br>
        Description: Now this was even more of a step up. I moved to this club knowing its reputation of getting kids recruited by top schools, so I knew what I was getting into. Not only do we travel further for games and tournaments, we're treated like professionals while we're away. Phones are taken away at curfew, we're on a strict diet to make sure we have the right nutrition for games, and we are held to the highest standard of behavior. We started in the GA league, playing against teams like PASC, but moved to ECNL to play at an even higher level.

    <div class = "box5">
        <span class= "box-header">Team #5: Menlo Girls Soccer</span> <br>
        Time: 2019-present <br>
        Description: I started playing Menlo soccer my freshman year, and have played every season from then to now. I was the starting varsity goalkeeper and still am today. It's a lot more relaxed then my club team, but still a competitive environment with our drive to win league every year.
